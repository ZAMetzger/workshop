### Stevens' Response

1. Stevens' technique is called random foresting. This technique is a semi-automated dasymetric modeling approach. Random forest is an estimation technique that is used to estimate population density at 100 m spatial resolution. Random foresting weights different variables to be layered in order to come up with the most accurate population density. 

2. Machine learning algorithms allow the computer to determine the best or most accurate way to interpret the data. In the terms of random foresting machine learning allows the computer to determine the accuracy of the weight of each variable that is applied to the map. Random foresting allows for the data to be looked at unbiased. The computer determines the value of the data rather than another person.
3. Scientists use a wide variety of variables that range from water to roads to trees to types of buildings. This data is collected on a very large scale. Because of this big data computer algorithms have more information to look at when creating their estimations. Big data shows us how some variables we would have deemed insignificant can actually be significant in estimations of density. 
4. Having access to accurate population density can really enlighten aid workers when trying to support some LMIC's. If they know where people are, then they can provide accurate support. If a pandemic were to break out, then aid workers could have a more accurate understanding of how many vaccines would be required. This can also help minimize the spread of illness because they can see where people are more likely to travel causing the spread of the disease.
5. When looking at neonatal health and climate change in Nicaragua, it is important to know where everyone lives. Climate change impacts the different regions in different ways. The way climate change impacts the region effects how the people will respond. It also determines what resources those people have access to. The resources can impact what the mother, fetus, infant, or child has access to.
