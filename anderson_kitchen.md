### Anderson and Kitchen

​	Anderson makes the claim that big data is the "end of theory." We are currently in the Petabyte Age. This means we are storing more data than ever before. Because there is so much data, we can no longer look at it all at once. We cannot analyze it by ourselves. Anderson says that it is looked at mathematically, then put into context. He uses the example of Google taking over the advertising world with only data and analytical tools. Anderson's concern is that big data is destroying the sciences. Anderson emphasizes the new idea of  "correlation is enough." Kitchen believes that big data is opening the door for better and bigger scientific research. Big data provides access to more, faster, accurate, and cheaper data. There are so many algorithms to apply to data. Kitchen makes the point that instead of selecting an method based on their knowledge of techniques and the data, data analytics can gain insights ‘born from the data’. Anderson and Kitchen seem to agree that there is  new form of research that looks at the data and then tries to find a question. Anderson feels as though this is killing theory, but Kitchen feels as though this is opening our minds to new theories. I agree more with Kitchen because I believe that big data will provide better ways to explore the world around us and the future. While analysis of big data is not perfect and has its limitations, there is great potential for new discoveries.
