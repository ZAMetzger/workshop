​	The paper published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) illustrates how the climate is changing, how it is affecting the people, and the predictions for the future in Nicaragua. UNDP begins by making the claim climate change is not only negatively impacting human development but actually reversing it. Human development, as defined by Amartya Sen, is the expansion of real freedoms. The paper discusses how climate change is affecting those in poverty the most. That means people with less economic and social freedoms will become even more unfree as a result of the impacts of climate change. Climate change in Nicaragua causes a decrease in agricultural production, insecurity in water resources, an increase coastal flooding, etc. All of these factors directly negatively impact those in poverty because their already limited access to resources is even more limited. 

​	The publishing is promoting a goal of a long and healthy life and a decent standard of life. The paper discusses the negative impacts climate change has to the health of the Nicaraguan people. For example, higher temperatures result in an increase in malaria and other diseases and a change in topography results in raspatory issues. While the main emphasis of human development is related to a long and healthy life, there is also a mention of how climate change could affect the economy or a decent standard of life. Climate change would negatively impact agriculture which would get rid of an income for farmers. Also, severe flooding and winds will displace people from homes and communities causing other communities to become overpopulated. An overpopulated area will not have enough opportunities for people to get jobs. Thus, resulting in a negative impact on the economy.
​	To support the project, integrating climate change risks and opportunities into national development processes and United Nations country programming, backed by the UNDP, they first had to develop a climate profile. They created a map using the main vulnerabilities of the country to climate change. This project was supported by the Nicaraguan government, so the data collected by the government was accessible to the UNDP for their use to create the climate vulnerability map. The UNDP also had access to a Climate Risk Screening of the UNDAF Nicaragua 2008-2012. There was also a Climate Risks Screening of four sectors of the PNDH. There was also an emphasis on the geographical location of Nicaragua which made it more prone to some effects of climate change. MARENA provides the data analysis on how climate change has impacted or will impact the different areas in Nicaragua. For example, the North and West of the country are located in zones are the most prone to the affects of climate change, such as high winds and flooding. 
​	The article is more about what has to be done in order to promote human development surrounding climate change, so it is not discussed what data science tools are used in order to draw such conclusions. Based on such conclusions, the UNDP discusses the need to place an emphasis on support led development. They believe that the Nicaraguan people cannot become freer without climate change being solved first. They are pushing for policy change in order to combat the impact of climate change. The UNDP was looking to see how climate change was impacting Nicaragua. Once they discovered this, the next question was what can be done to support the people of Nicaragua?s://www.undp.org/content/dam/aplaws/publication/ en/publications/environment-energy/www-ee-library/climate-change/mainstreaming-climate-change-in-nicaragua/CC risk Mainstreaming Climate Change in Nicaragua ENG.pdf
