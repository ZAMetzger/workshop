## Literature Review

##### Introduction

​	There is a lot of information about the various plights in Nicaragua. Research can be found about climate change, or neonatal health and survival. Some research may mention how climate change may impact the health and survival of the mother, fetus, or child, but there is a lack of quantitative data to support it. The negative effects of a changing environment could potentially have a negative impact on pregnant women and their children. That is why I would like to fill the gap in literature by understand more about the correlation between climate change and neonatal health. How exactly is climate change impacting the future generation of Nicaragua? Nicaragua has issues with governmental corruption, health care, and economic equality. What can be done at an administrative level for pregnant women and their children experiencing issues as a result of climate change?

##### Human Development Goals

###### <u>Climate Change</u>

​	I started with research about climate change in Nicaragua. By looking at many different variables about the environment of Nicaragua, I will be able to understand the changing climate and its impact on the physical environment. Climate change is visible to different areas in different ways. For example, California and Australia are dealing with extreme fires and drought, while other areas are dealing with severe flooding and mudslides. Climate change alters the physical environment in which a mother is caring and raising a child in. If that environment is ever changing or unstable, how will it impact the child?

​	The most enlightening information came from *Toward a Political Ecology of Migration: Land, Labor Migration, and Climate Change in Northwestern Nicaragua*[3]. The research conducted by Carte, Mardero, Radel, and Schmook looks into how climate change is affecting labor migration. As climate change is destroying the land, rural peasant families are having to migrate to find jobs and places to live. These already struggling people are being forced to uproot an start over, as a result of the destruction of climate change. They cannot work because their farms are not able to yield crops. The rest of the country does not have enough job opportunities for all of those from rural communities migrating. 

​	While the research does not discuss the direct correlation between climate change and neonatal health, there are many assumptions that can be drawn. The migration discussed would not be good for a mother and her fetus. Not having food or a stable home would cause stress and other health issues. The migration can also cause a lack of access to proper and stable medical support. 

###### <u>Neonatal Health and Pregnancies</u>

​	Next I looked at pregnancies in Nicaragua. This information would help me understand what is currently happening in Nicaragua with neonatal health and survival. This is a good base layer of understanding why child birth and child survival is an issue in Nicaragua. 

​	The research that illustrated the most important information was *Adolescent Childbearing in Nicaragua: A Quantitative Assessment of Associated Factors*[2].  The study conducted by Lion, Prata, and Stewart illustrated that those who had their first sexual experience prior to the age of 15 were more likely to get pregnant at a younger age. They were then able to identify younger sexual experiences had a correlation to a lack of education and financial support.

​	Education is important when dealing with health of oneself and the health of a child. The research done by Lion, Prata, and Stewart determined that only 37% of women who  have had a sexual experience attended secondary school. There is a correlation between a lack of education and younger sexual debuts. When a young woman has a child, her education is then impacted because children tend to take priority. While 96% were aware of contraceptive methods, only 11% knew about the ovulatory cycle. If women do not understand how their own bodies work it is harder for them to have comfortable and safe sex. Lion, Prata, and Stewart also observed that people from rural regions were at higher risk of having an earlier first birth than were urban residents. Rural communities are known to have lower chances for economic prosperity. Those living in poorer conditions have children at younger ages.

##### Correlation

​	One research group did analyze the correlation between climate change and health. The authors explain how it is recognized that climate change has a negative impact on human health, especially pregnant women and newborns. They illustrate lack of food and safe drinking water, poor sanitation, population migration, changing disease patterns and morbidity, more frequent extreme weather events, and lack of shelter as the repercussions of climate change that are affecting health. Pregnant women and infants are at risk of not having a long and healthy life. Climate change is causing temperatures to rise which results in various issues. For example, rising temperatures results in diseases to be spread more easily and rapidly. Heat can alone can also cause a lot of issues for pregnant women and children because working in the heat can cause one to experience extreme dehydration. If climate change is not taken care of, then we cannot ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Those left out will be pregnant women, fetuses, and infants.

​	A lot of the data the researchers used came from WHO's database. This includes data on dieses, pregnancies, and overall health of people all over the world. They also got data analysis from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The publishing does not discuss how the data is collected and analyzed. The group just was able to draw conclusions from combining various publishing's. This research is lacking information about the data analyzation. While they are drawing important conclusions, they do not have a lot of hard data to back up their claims.

##### Data Science Methods

###### <u>Climate Change</u>

​	The data used to come to such conclusions mostly came from face-to-face interview surveys. These surveys were conducted by the research team to learn about labor migration and the reasoning behind it. The recordings from the qualitative surveys and workshops, which were iteratively coded for specific topics, alongside of the quantitative themes to draw conclusions. They used SPSS, a software package that uses machine learning for program for statistical analysis in social science, to analyze the quantitative data. Survey data can be very valuable to research. This data can represent a more personal take on findings. People who tend to be left out by larger data sets can have their voice heard. This makes survey data very important when analyzing low and middle income countries, such as Nicaragua.

​	To illustrate temperature and rainfall change they looked at data from the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies. Climate change was also illustrated by the use of an online analysis tool, World Climate Analysis. The World Climate Analysis tool uses satellite data from the University of Delaware's Global Climate Research Page's. The data is then calculated under a linear model. Satellite data is very useful because it is not restricted by administrative boundaries. It is also very accurate and precise. By combining the results of the survey data and the satellite data, Radel and her team could "illustrate the reality of unpredictable, variable rains, as well as a growing concern over the increase in drought conditions..." The group concluded that their findings illustrate a negative impact on the livelihood of those who rely on local agriculture. 

###### <u>Neonatal Health and Pregnancies</u>

​	Much of the data came from 2001 Nicaragua Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Again, the survey data is important for understanding what personally is going on with these women and their sexual experiences and education. Data were analyzed with Intercooled STATA 8.0, using the appropriate DHS-assigned survey weighting. The survey weighting allows for the collected information to be analyzed appropriately. They performed the Cox proportional hazard modeling with residence, education, and wealth quintile in a bivariate model. The Cox proportional hazard model is a regression model that measures the risk of failure. It is commonly used in the medical field to measure survival. They produced a multivariate model by combining all of these variables. Finally, Bivariate testing was used to select the most important variables.

​	The Cox multivariate model and the Bivariate model both illustrated that those who live in rural areas or in poverty were at a higher risk of a young pregnancy. The research does not discuss this, but those in the rural regions are most impacted by climate change. So, if there are more young mothers in a region with uncertain climate, then the mothers, fetus, and children are at a higher risk for health issues.  While the lack of education and financial support is the cause for young pregnancies and some complications, the extreme effects of climate change could heighten the risk for mothers, fetus', and children. 

##### Extended Research

​	As I continued to read about climate change and neonatal health and survival, I noticed two common and similar variables. Poverty and education seem to be the most limiting factors. I decided to look into two different readings about poverty and education to try and understand their impact on Nicaraguan people.

​	The paper *Socio-economic resources, young child feeding practices, consumption of highly processed snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages: a population-based survey in rural northwestern Nicaragua* [10] discovered, "Regardless of educational strata, it seems that the children in the community are exposed to both suboptimal practices of the recommended feeding practices as well as exposure to HP snacks and SSBs; that is to say, a dual burden of suboptimal feeding." This is interesting because it is illustrating a lack of education of a region about proper child feeding. Or it could also illustrate a regional lack of access to proper food. This could be a result of the destruction of agriculture as a result of climate change.

​	After the north-west region of Nicaragua was struck by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, the local stakeholders wanted to find a way to break the cycles of Nicaragua. The paper *Breaking the cycles of poverty: Strategies, achievements, and lessons learned in Los Cuatro Santos, Nicaragua, 1990–2014* [9] discusses how this progress was tracked. They used DHS for the 25, 893 people living in 5,966 households in 2014.  By focusing the support on local ownership, political reconciliation, consensus decision-making, social and gender equity, an **environmental and public health perspective**, and **sustainability**, Blandon, Kallestal, Pena, Perez, Berglund, Contreras, and Persson were ale to see a positive shift in poverty and health. "During the last decade, the proportion of individuals living in poverty was reduced from 79 to 47%. Primary school enrolment increased from 70 to 98% after the start of the school breakfast program. Under-five mortality was around 50 per 1,000 live births in 1990 and again peaked after Hurricane Mitch and was approaching 20 per 1,000 in 2014. "

​	Their research illustrated that by supporting environmental protection among other guiding principals, both poverty an neonatal issues declined dramatically. The work done post 1998  can be used to support the claim that climate change has an impact on neonatal health and survival. 

##### Filling the Gap

​	Based on the gap in literature about the correlation between climate change and neonatal health and survival, I want to aggregate and join geospatial and DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys) data sources, each source describing Nicaragua in terms of climate change and childbirth. By using random forest and hierarchical Bayesian models, I will be able to analyze the correlation between the climate change and child birth and health. 

##### Future Goals

​	By filling the literature gap, there is a hope that there can be changes that help support the Nicaraguan people.  Instead of only focusing on what to do after there are complications with pregnancies and young children, this information could help prevent or look for ways to mitigate these challenges.  The goal is, similarly to what happened in north-western Nicaragua, people understand that the changes need to be made at the national level in order to protect the future generations of Nicaragua.  Instead of only focusing on what to do after there are complications with pregnancies and young children, this information could help prevent or look for ways to mitigate the challenges surrounding neonatal health and survival.
