# Response to Joshua Blumenstock's article

#### Describe the promise, platifs, and ways forward Blumenstock uses as the foundation for his thesis. 
Blumenstock talks about the great potential that data science has for human development. He demonstrates that big data, or the 
large collections of data such as cell phone data, could help people who are in lower income communities. Census data is rarely taken and 
expensive. Census data also tends not to reach those who are living in extreme poverty. Big data has the ability to illustrate a more 
accurate representation of a community because of the breadth of its reach. Blumenstock focuses a lot on cell phone data and how the 
economic status of a community can be determined by the amount of cell phone usage and how the phones areas used. Satalite data doesn't 
leave anyone out, is faster, and cheaper. One of the issues with big data is that it can be skewed. The way people use their phones 
could change and the assumptions could then no longer be correct. Sometimes, when in refrence to aid usually, people can purposly skew the 
data. For example, when people found out aid was being distributed to areas that had thatched roofing, people in richer communities started 
to build more sheds with thatched roofing. The data on the style of roofing was no longer an accurate representation for aid distribution. 
Going forward Blumenstock wants big data to be used to support the older methods of data analysis. He also emphasises that the data and 
data collection should be updated to better support lower income countries. 

#### How do you respond to these ideas regarding “good intent”, “transparency” and the difficult “balancing act” when considering the intersection of human development with data science?
Human development is the changing of communities as the world changes around them. Blumenstock discusses how big data can help support 
human development but also the issues that big data could bring. I agree with Anna with her claim that good intent is not enough to fully 
back the use of such data. Using communities of people to experiment with new data analysis is not fair. You are dealing with someone's 
livelihood. However, I do belive in the use of data to support pre-existing ideas. Nira's statement about transparency could solve a lot of 
the issues that would arise with the use of big data. If there was more all around transparency the suffering communities would not be left 
out. The data companies and private companies should be in communication with non-profits and governments. This would allow for private 
companies to fine-tune their data while helping communities. Private companies do not have as much of an incentive to support the local 
people because there is not a profit involved. Some organizations offer opportunities to get data scientists to understand the lower income 
communities on a personal level. This could allow data scientists to sympathize with such areas. While the balancing act between the new 
and old data could be challenging, it is necessary until the new data can become more refined. Machine learning will only improve such 
methods going forward.
