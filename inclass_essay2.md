​	The movie, *City of God*, takes us through the life of a few residents of the City of God. Each of their paths changed the way the city functioned and grew. The City of God started as a smaller, more rural area, but it soon grew into a large, bustling city.  Even though the city was changing, the same issues were arising because there was still poverty, corruption, and greed as evidence by the stories of Lil' Z, Benny, and Rocket.

​	Lil' Z started off as Lil' Dice. He was the youngest of a group of gangsters who would commit small crimes in order to bring in some money. At this time they lived in the more rural City of God. The police would come and occasionally harass the residents as a result of racism. Thus, keeping the city in a state of poverty. Lil' Z's group went one night to rob a motel. This was Lil' Z's idea, but he wasn't allowed to participate in the job. After Lil' Z was tired of being talked down to, he made it seem like the cops had taken him. In reality, Lil' Z went on a killing spree inside the motel. This caused a super-linear presence of police in the City of God. This resulted in every older member of the group to be killed leaving Lil' Z without any restrictions. Lil' Z became the definition of gangs. As the city began to grow and drugs were introduced, the dynamic of the City of God changed.

​	Everyone liked drugs. You could find drugs in every race, status, and region. This gave people like Lil' Z all the power. He soon took over the entire city. When the city is run by one gang, violence, robbery, and police intervention are limited causing a sub-linear representation of robberies, rape, and violent deaths. This allowed Benny, Lil' Z's right hand man, to explore the lifestyle of a hippie. Benny helped continue the flow of drugs while maintaining the peace. He kept Lil' Z level headed. Even when Carrot, the head of an area of the city, had lost control of the runts, Benny had kept the idea of violence out of the equation. When Benny deiced to leave to become a full on hippy with his girlfriend, Lil' Z got mad. In the midst of their fight, Benny was accidentally shot. This started a full out war in the city. The violence and gang members grew at a super-linear rate. Gangs were recruiting everyone. This increased the amount of weapons also at a sub-linear rate. The death of Benny broke the peace.

​	Benny respected Rocket. Rocket's older brothers was one of the older members of Lil' Z's original group. Rocket had always had a passion for photography. Before Benny died, he gave Rocket a camera which was taken by Lil' Z. During the war between Carrot and Lil' Z, one of Carrot's top men was captured by police and put on the cover of every news source. This made Lil' Z jealous. He ended up giving Rocket the camera to take pictures of him and his gang. This small gesture allowed Rocket to show the rest of the world the violence of gangs and young children. Rocket was also able to capture the corruption of the police. Even though the police are supposed to stop the crime and violence, they gain from the profits of the gang members. If an istitution, such as the police, are not stopping the violence, then the city will continue its development as a violent, drug, and gang filled area. 

​	The city grew and developed around crime, violence, racism, and corruption. This environment sparks an endless cycle of gangs and violence. If gangs, drugs, and violence are what's closest to you, that's what you know, that's what you learn. Rocket was an exception to this cycle. HE was able to escape through a passion of his. He was willing to work hard. He was more passionate about photography than money. This saved him from dying in the streets like everyone else. The story started out with a group of four young men who were gangsters. By the end, the whole city is filled with gangsters. As the city grew, so did the amount of violence and gang members. At the end of the movie we see a larger group of boys standing over Lil' Z's dead body. Ultimately, the city grew, the violence grew, and the gangs grew.
